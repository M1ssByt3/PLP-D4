    Documentation: Extensive documentation is created at each phase, which can be useful for future reference and compliance.

    Predictability: Well-defined requirements and plans make it easier to estimate timelines and costs upfront.

    Suitability for Stable Requirements: Ideal for projects with well-understood and stable requirements that are unlikely to change.

Disadvantages:

    Inflexibility: Difficult to accommodate changes once the project has moved to the next phase.

    Late Testing: Testing occurs only after the implementation phase, which can lead to the discovery of major issues late in the project.

    Risk of Overruns: Any delays in early phases can impact the entire project timeline and budget.

    Limited Stakeholder Involvement: Stakeholders are typically involved only at the beginning and end, reducing opportunities for feedback.

Agile Methodology: an iterative, incremental approach that focuses on delivering small, functional pieces of the project in short cycles (sprints). It emphasizes collaboration, flexibility, and customer feedback.

Advantages:

    Flexibility: Easily accommodates changes in requirements, even late in the development process.

    Continuous Feedback: Regular involvement of stakeholders ensures that the product meets their needs and expectations.

    Early and Frequent Delivery: Functional increments are delivered frequently, providing early value and reducing time to market.

    Improved Quality: Continuous testing and integration help identify and resolve issues early.

Disadvantages:

    Requires Active Stakeholder Involvement: Continuous collaboration and feedback are essential, which can be demanding for stakeholders.

    Less Predictability: The iterative nature can make it harder to predict timelines and costs accurately.

    Documentation: Less emphasis on comprehensive documentation can lead to knowledge gaps if team members leave.

    Complexity in Management: Managing multiple iterations and frequent changes can be more complex and require skilled project management.

# 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
        Agile is more beneficial for projects with evolving requirements, high stakeholder involvement, and a need for flexibility and rapid delivery. Examples include software development for startups, mobile app development, and e-commerce platforms.

    Waterfall is more suitable for projects with stable, well-defined requirements, strict regulatory needs, and predictable outcomes. Examples include construction projects, manufacturing processes, and government contracts.

# 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?

Methods for Ensuring Quality Assurance:

    Requirement Analysis: Thoroughly analyze and document requirements to ensure they are clear, complete, and testable.
